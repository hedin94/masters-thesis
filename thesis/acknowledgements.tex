\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Configura for giving me the opportunity to do my thesis work at the company. Also, a special thanks to my supervisor Martin Olsson at Configura for always taking his time to help me whenever I needed it. I would also like to thank Harald Nautsch and Ingemar Ragnemalm at Linköping University for weekly input and support. Lastly, I would like to thank Erik Hansson for valuable comments on the report.
