    \section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

        In order to determine which of these algorithms provide the best performance for a target appearance threshold, an evaluation of the polygon count, computation time, memory usage and rendering time of the simplified mesh is done for each of the implemented solutions. In the results from this step, a series of tables are generated to compare the performance between the algorithms by using a common comparison framework. In this section, we describe this common comparison framework and then show how we can measure each of the parameters.

        In essence, this is done by targeting a certain appearance threshold, tweaking the mesh simplification algorithm's parameters to achieve this threshold, and then measuring the given performance. This gives a universal measure of ``quality'' for all of the algorithms, which would otherwise have different error metrics used for applying the simplification. Since the performance measures are noisy, a total of \(n=20\) samples will be taken. According to \emph{David Lilja}~\cite[p.~50]{lilja2005measuring} the t-student distribution should be used when \(n < 30\), as shown in Section~\ref{sec:measuring_algorithmic_performance}.

        The pack of test meshes that are going to be used in the comparison are a combination of textured models provided by Configura and others taken from the public domain. The exact selection of these is still to be decided, but should include both low- \& high-polygon meshes.
