Hello there kind reader!

You'll find the latest draft in `thesis.pdf`.

If you for some reason want to build it yourself:

1. Go to the root of this project.

2. Call `make` and hope for the best.

3. Open `thesis.pdf` in your favorite pdf viewer.

4. Or just call `make view` if you're using `evince`.
