\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Rendering of large polygonal meshes in real-time consumes valuable computation time that
could otherwise be used for other problems. If the amount of polygons can be reduced without
affecting the visual quality of the final render significantly, then we can save computation time
and memory. Algorithms that reduce the polygon count of a mesh based on some metric are
called mesh simplification algorithms. An issue that has been found in industry and research is
that the quality of the texture coordinates use for texture mapping are degraded when this
simplification algorithm is applied.

\section{Aim}
\label{sec:aim}

First to survey the field for state-of-the-art mesh simplification algorithms that preserve the visual appearance of meshes and then integrate these into Configura's graphics pipeline. Thereafter, we evaluate each of these by measuring the algorithm's performance and appearance preservation properties. Our goal is to find the mesh simplification algorithm which suits Configura's requirements best.

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research-questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How can \emph{mesh simplification} be done without affecting the \emph{visual appearance} significantly?

\item What are the alternatives to achieve \emph{mesh simplification} with \emph{appearance preservation}?

\item{Which alternative gives the best effect considering \emph{performance} and  \emph{appearance preservation}?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item When measuring the algorithm's \emph{computation time} while targeting an \emph{appearance threshold}?
  \item When measuring the algorithm's \emph{memory usage} while targeting an \emph{appearance threshold}?
  \item When measuring the \emph{rendering time} of the simplified mesh? 
  \end{enumerate}
}
\item Which alternative gives the best \emph{appearance preservation} when targeting a certain \emph{polygon count threshold}?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Delimitations}
\label{sec:delimitations}

Since there are many mesh simplification algorithms in previous work, a proper literature review would have to be done to find possible candidates for implementation. However, since this thesis is mostly concerned with implementing and measuring the performance, we've decided to base our choices on existing surveys and literature reviews to skip doing a literature review ourselves.

Also, since implementing and doing measurements on all algorithms would take too long, we've decided to only pick a interesting subset of the algorithms presented in the surveys.
